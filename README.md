# data-science-for-autos
Python Basics for Data Science Project using automobiles data

In this project the following steps were made:

- Loaded de CVS file
- Retreived the data
- Created the headers on the data
- Removed the "NaN" datas
- Applied techniques of Machine Learning, such as:
- LINEAR REGRESSION
- MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION 
- REGRESSION PLOT 
- RESIDUAL PLOT 
- DISTRIBUTION PLOT
- R SQUARED (R^2)

And finally performed the prediction of the car's price for a car with a Highway MPG equals 30
